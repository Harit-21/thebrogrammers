This is the official github for TheMadBrogrammers where we'll understand the web dev (this is the begginning) and not just like learning one thing and then implementing it BUT about any topic we wanna understand while building a project. Now if you ask what is the project, well thenit is of your own and now if you say that "I don't have or got any project". WELLLL then there must be something on the web which incredibly intrigued you when you saw that and wanted to know that "HOW ON EARTH COULD THIS BE MADE". I mean yeah not to exagerrate but there certainly are a few or perhaps many things on web which is mind blowingly insanely damn good.

SO YEs, start with that and NOW if you say that "I don't even understand that how can the mouse cursor can be changed to something else, that is some ultra level sh*t, AND THAT IS HOW YOU UNDERSTNAD non-conventionally, JUST START WITH "THAT INTRIGUING STUFF", ask ai's and search engines to explain that to you, go for documentation of those languages, THAT LITERALLY is the great way to UNDERSTAND.

AND whenever you find the BEST Resource on any topic you are studying, just share that on TheBroGrammers Community, i.e. on this git repo and I'll put it here for THE GREAT HELP YOU DID, for someone coming here future to have the almost GREATEST resoures to understand from any to every topic!
