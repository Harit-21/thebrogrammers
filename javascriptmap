Ah, I see! Youâ€™re asking how you can learn and understand how code like this works, rather than just looking at a given solution. Understanding code and learning how it works is a gradual process that involves exploring several key areas. Hereâ€™s a roadmap for you to learn how to understand and write similar code, along with some tips and resources.

### Steps to Learn and Understand Code Like This:

#### 1. **Understand JavaScript Fundamentals**

Before diving into more complex code, itâ€™s essential to understand the core concepts of JavaScript. Here's a list of foundational topics to get you started:

* **Variables and Data Types**: Learn how to store and manipulate data using variables (`let`, `const`, `var`), and basic data types like strings, numbers, arrays, and objects.
* **Functions**: Understand how to define and invoke functions, and how parameters and return values work.
* **Control Flow**: Learn about `if`, `else`, `for`, `while` loops, and how they control the flow of a program.
* **Objects and Arrays**: Get comfortable with storing data in objects and arrays, and how to manipulate them.
* **Event Handling**: Learn how events (like clicks, scrolling, and resizing) are handled in JavaScript.

**Resources**:

* [MDN Web Docs - JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
* [JavaScript.info](https://javascript.info/)

#### 2. **Learn DOM Manipulation and Events**

Once youâ€™re familiar with JavaScript basics, the next step is to understand the **DOM (Document Object Model)** and how JavaScript interacts with the web page.

* **DOM**: This represents the structure of the webpage, and JavaScript lets you interact with it (e.g., manipulating HTML elements, adding event listeners).
* **Event Listeners**: Learn how to listen for user interactions (e.g., clicks, scrolls, key presses) and how to respond to those events.

**Example Topics to Learn**:

* **`addEventListener()`**: How to listen for events like `click`, `scroll`, `resize`, etc.
* **`window.scrollY`**: How to track the scroll position.
* **`window.resize`**: How to detect when the window is resized.

**Resources**:

* [MDN DOM Events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventListener)
* [DOM Manipulation Tutorials (JavaScript.info)](https://javascript.info/document)

#### 3. **Responsive Design & Media Queries**

In your code, the `window.matchMedia()` function is used to check if the screen width is smaller than 768px (a typical mobile breakpoint). To understand this, youâ€™ll need to learn about **responsive design** and how to use **media queries** in CSS.

* **Responsive Design**: Design your website to adapt to different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
* **Media Queries**: These allow you to apply styles based on conditions like screen size.

**Example Topics**:

* **CSS Media Queries**: `@media` queries for different screen sizes (e.g., `(max-width: 768px)`).
* **JavaScript with `matchMedia()`**: This JavaScript function lets you detect the current viewport size and trigger events when the screen size changes.

**Resources**:

* [MDN - Media Queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries)
* [CSS Tricks - Media Queries](https://css-tricks.com/media-queries-for-standard-devices/)

#### 4. **Working with Window Events (Resize, Scroll, etc.)**

The code youâ€™re asking about deals with events like `scroll` and `resize`. These are critical for building responsive and interactive web pages.

* **`scroll` Event**: This event fires when the user scrolls the page. You can use this to track the scroll position, change elements on the page, or implement features like lazy loading.
* **`resize` Event**: This event fires when the window is resized. Itâ€™s commonly used to handle responsive layouts or to adapt to different screen sizes.

**Resources**:

* [JavaScript.info - Browser Events](https://javascript.info/introduction-browser-events)

---

#### 5. **Practical Experimentation**

Once you understand the theory, itâ€™s important to practice by building projects and experimenting with the code yourself. Here's how:

* **Try Small Examples**: Start by experimenting with small scripts to see how `addEventListener()`, `scroll`, and `resize` work.
* **Build Simple Projects**: Create basic interactive web pages (e.g., a scrollable page that changes the background color as you scroll).
* **Debug and Test**: Use browser tools (DevTools) to debug and experiment with real-time changes to JavaScript and the DOM.

**Tools to Try**:

* [CodePen](https://codepen.io/): A great platform for experimenting with small code snippets.
* [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/): Another platform to test your JavaScript and see real-time results.

#### 6. **Learn by Example and Reference**

When you're looking at complex code, it's helpful to break it down and refer to documentation for every function you're unsure about. Try to understand each line of code before moving on.

**For Example**:

* **`matchMedia()`**: If you're not sure how `window.matchMedia()` works, go to MDN and look up the documentation. Youâ€™ll find detailed explanations and examples.
* **`addEventListener('change')`**: Understand how event listeners work by reading through MDN docs and examples.

---

#### 7. **Keep Practicing and Build Projects**

To fully understand how everything works together, **build projects** that involve:

* Responsive design (handling different screen sizes).
* Tracking user actions (scrolling, resizing).
* Dynamically updating the UI based on those actions.

#### Example Projects:

* **Scroll Animations**: Create a page where different elements animate based on how far youâ€™ve scrolled.
* **Responsive Navigation Menu**: A navigation menu that changes layout depending on the screen size.
* **Sticky Header**: A header that stays fixed at the top as you scroll.

### Final Advice:

Start simple, break down complex code, and build projects. Experiment with small examples, read documentation, and gradually increase the complexity of your projects. By working hands-on and continuously experimenting with code, youâ€™ll deepen your understanding of how web development works and become more confident in reading and writing complex code like the one you shared.
